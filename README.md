# Airgead-Banking

This program was made to encourage high school students to invest their money. Also, to help them see how saving benefits them. You type in all of the information and it makes calculations based off of your instructions. You can put only a set amount once, or make additional monthly contributions. Then you let the calculator know how much intrest and how many years you want to invest. Then it displays all of the information for you!
